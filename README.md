# Begginers_python_compilation
A beginner's journey advancing in Python: A simple collection of Python projects to help progress in skills.

This is my log of improving my skills from print("Hello World") to my dream (a secret :P)

I wish to help beginners in their journey of programming by trying to explain concepts and ideas via my program. I want to share not just my program but the explanation of how I did it and the thought process I followed in a way that a beginner will be able to fully understand and build it on their own rather than simply copying and pasting code.

I aim not to give a complicated super concise code to solve the problem, but a bit larger easily understandable code that will enhance programming skills and expertise rather than plagiarism ability. 

My goal is to share my journey and explain it so that the readers not just get new ideas but also the method to act on the ideas.

Feel free to contribute! Cheers!
